FAST_INDUSTRIES_POSITIONING.md
Fast Industries positions the Firmament Engine as a modular, deterministic,
and transparent cognitive platform designed for environments that require:

- Symbolic reasoning
- Truth maintenance
- Structured concept graphs
- Governance-based safety
- Visual cognition and topology mapping
- Local-first deployment
- Auditable logic flows

The Firmament Engine combines these elements into a unified architecture that
prioritizes explainability, determinism, reliability, and offline operation.

Its differentiation is based on **architecture**, **governance**, and
**deterministic reasoning**, rather than model size or cloud services.

# 8. Growth Strategy

**Phase 1 — Developer Adoption**  
Open-source documentation, public APIs, and examples to help developers
experiment with structured reasoning tools.

**Phase 2 — Enterprise Pilots**  
Partner with organizations that need deterministic, inspectable cognitive
systems for internal workflows.

**Phase 3 — Cognitive Multi-Agent Platform**  
Introduce support for controlled multi-agent reasoning using Firmament's
governed truth and inference layers.
